This is a high-level API of FileManager

Attributes- input_file, output_file, input_text, output_text

KeyPoint- Should not distinguish between a URL and files on disk.
	  For that to happen, 'file_open' should mean extracting text
	  from the input file.

Methods- input_file_open(), output_write(output_text)
